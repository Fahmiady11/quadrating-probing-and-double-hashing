This is a comparison of Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing for resolving collisions in hash tables.

Included is an implementation of one hash table using Quadratic Probing and one using Double Hashing, as well as a count for the number of comparisons during key insertion in both implementations.

The implementations were tested and my analysis of the results can be found in the analysis file.
